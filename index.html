  <h1 id="Gameplay">The Gameplay and Stakes at Hand</h1>
  <p>Dead by Daylight is an asymetrical and multiplayer horror game where the goal is to escape and survive.</p>
  <p>You are faced against 1 killer and must survive with 3 other people and work together to escape from them.</p>
  <p>(At least that's what the game wants but you could also be a lone survivor till the end of the match).</p>

  <h1 id="Narrative">Narrative Arc and Lore</h1>
  <p>So what is Dead by Daylight? Each single time you play, you are playing in a "realm" or like a plane of existence.</p>
  <p>You can also think of it as you playing in a really violent chess board as pawns of a being called "The Entity".</p>
  <p>Each character is stolen from another plan of existence similar to earth and is brought here to survive trails against monsters, killers, and evil forces from different films and intellectual properties.</p>

  <h1 id="Ending">Ending a Match & Extra Goals</h1>
  <p>Aside from just escaping on your own, altruism is also heavily rewarded. Due to there being 4 survivors, 3 escaping is considered a win while only 2 is considered a tie and 1 would be a loss.</p> 
  <p>There are a couple ways to save survivor as shown below:</p>

  <h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Dbd as the term is coined by many is a game that is very close to my heart. It is one that I have played since 2021 and has gotten me through mantimes through college and a way to kill time.</p>
  <p>I also want to pursue horror one day, which is why this game also motivates me to make something new in the genre.</p>
