<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">The Gameplay and Stakes at Hand.</h1>
<p>Dead by Daylight is an asymetrical and multiplayer horror game where the goal is to escape and survive.</p>
<p></p>You are faced against 1 killer and must survive with 3 other people and work together to escape from them.</p>
<p>(At least that's what the game wants but you could also be a lone survivor till the end of the match).</p>
<p>As survivor, you must fix 5 out of 7 generators placed on the map to power 2 exit gates.</p>
<p>If only one survivor remains, a hatch can spawn on the map that is placed as a 3rd escape option</p>
<p>As killer, you must hook all 4 survivors 3 times or kill them before they can escape.</p>
<p>Mouse and keyboard is the most optimal way to play this game and it is also crossplay between different</p>
<p>platforms. The biggest difference in gameplay between controller and mouse is the camera movement</p>
<p>speed is significantly faster on mouse and keyboard. This matters heavily for playing killer or</p>
<p>survivor as that allows you to see your surroundings which brings me to the next important gameplay loop.</p>
<p>(P.S:There is an enourmous amount of information and multitasking that this game demands).</p>

<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;">


<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Survivor Gameplay</h1>
<p>Part of the gameplay involves dodging and "looping" each killer while playing as survivor. Looping in this</p>
<p>case means to have the killer chase you for as long as possible. Each second you take their attention is</p>
<p>a moment that allows your teammates to fix a generator, which makes it count. The other reason you need to</p>
<p>dodge is due to a 3 health state system. When hit the first time, you are just injured until you can be healed</p>
<p>by yourself via medkit(1st image below) or a teammate. The 2nd time, you are put into a "downed" state where you</p>
<p>are lying on the ground and need to be picked up by your teammates before the killer does within a certain time</p>
<p>frame. The 3rd health state is when you are picked up by the killer, which can give teammates a chance to set</p>
<p>you free from their grasp with coordination. While you loop, you also need to be aware of where the killer is</p>
<p>within your surroundings as pallets allow you to delay chase. You can also dodge attacks by vaulting windows</p>
<p>that are placed nearby.</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Killer Gameplay</h1>
<p>As killer, the gameplay is a little more complex than just trying to get rid of these pesky survivors.</p>
<p>You need to dodge attempts of survivors wasting your time either by taking your attention, trying to be</p>
<p>altruistic by saving other teammates, or by them being consistent on the generators. On top of these objectives,</p>
<p>you also need to learn how to use every killer's abilities and powers. Each single one tends to involve a lot</p>
<p>practice and patience. Throughout all killers, each have a basic (short distance) and range attack.</p>

<p>Clip of every killer attack (but for short purposes, the trapper is the first killer shown):</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Narrative Arc and Lore</h1>
<p>So what is Dead by Daylight? Each single time you play, you are playing in a "realm" or like a plane of existence.</p>
<p>You can also think of it as you playing in a really violent chess board as pawns of a being called "The Entity".</p>
<p>Each character is stolen from another plane of existence similar to earth and is brought here to survive trails</p>
<p>against monsters, killers, and evil forces from different films and intellectual properties.</p>
<p>Many characters were taken by force to play by the entity's game. Some killers however took interest and </p>
<p>barged their way into the realms to ensure carnage and chaos.</p>


<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;">


<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Ending a Match & Extra Goals</h1>
<p>Aside from just escaping on your own, altruism is also heavily rewarded. Due to there being 4 survivors, 3 escaping</p>
<p>is considered a win while only 2 is considered a tie and 1 would be a loss. Given that is the case,</p> 
<p>there are a couple ways to save another survivor as shown below:</p>

</video>

<p>and so on(a little hard to explain here but these 2 are the basic ways). It should also be noted that flashlights</p>
<p>in this game are not intended to light up a surface area. Instead, they are used to blind the killer to cause them to</p>
<p>let go of someone from their grasp or to disorient them.</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">The Sound Design:</h1>
<p>This theme plays when you enter the game:</p>
 <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="dbdtheme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
<p>Now while I would love to display every single sound element of this game, we would be here for a good</p>
<p>couple of hours. However, I do want to emphasize that this game does amazing to tell you what to do</p>
<p>without needing to see the objective. The part that makes the sound design unique is the fact that</p>
<p>every killer has unique sounds to them. The example would be the first ever killer of the game and his sounds:</p>
 <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="Trappersounds.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
<p>Each grunt has a purpose. Some of which that sound like pain are when you stun him. The slashing ones come from</p>
<p>his weapon which sounds viscious and horrifying to hear as survivor. Towards the end of the file, you can</p>
<p>hear the sounds of his breathing which can also be heard while he chases you. The sounds only get better</p>
<p>with each killer.</p>


<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;">

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">How does this relate to our readings?</h1>
<p>There is actually quite a few of the readings from the discussion post that can be applied here.</p>
<p>For the reasoning of why we play, this game exemplies the thrill of a back and forth battle.</p>
<p>It is a constant battle to keep pressure throughout the game. Given that there is a power</p>
<p>dynamic as there is only 1 killer vs 4 people, the killer's task is to kill everyone as</p>
<p>quickly as possible. By the end of the game, we feel the end of the repition that Frued</p>
<p>had talked about. When you first start out the game, it tends to be really scary.</p>
<p>However, when you start to accumulate many hours of gameplay, it becomes more like</p>
<p>an action movie loop gameplay where you know what to expect and the fear factor goes away.</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid white; width: 50%; margin: 20px auto;">
  
<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Dbd as the term is coined by many is a game that is very close to my heart. It is one that I have played </p>
<p>since 2021 and has gotten me through mantimes through college and a way to kill time.</p>
<p>I also want to pursue horror one day, which is why this game also motivates me to make something new in the genre.</p>
<p>The other part that makes the loop fun is that you get different teammates every single time.</p>
<p>While you may get the same killer with a similar build each time, everyone plays different from one another.</p>
