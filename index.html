<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">The Gameplay and Stakes at Hand.</h1>
<p>Dead by Daylight is an asymetrical and multiplayer horror game where the goal is to escape and survive.</p>
<p></p>You are faced against 1 killer and must survive with 3 other people and work together to escape from them.</p>
<p>(At least that's what the game wants but you could also be a lone survivor till the end of the match).</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Narrative Arc and Lore</h1>
<p>So what is Dead by Daylight? Each single time you play, you are playing in a "realm" or like a plane of existence.</p>
<p>You can also think of it as you playing in a really violent chess board as pawns of a being called "The Entity".</p>
<p>Each character is stolen from another plan of existence similar to earth and is brought here to survive trails</p>
<p>against monsters, killers, and evil forces from different films and intellectual properties.</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Ending a Match & Extra Goals</h1>
<p>Aside from just escaping on your own, altruism is also heavily rewarded. Due to there being 4 survivors, 3 escaping</p>
<p>is considered a win while only 2 is considered a tie and 1 would be a loss. Given that is the case,</p> 
<p>there are a couple ways to save survivor as shown below:</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244);">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Dbd as the term is coined by many is a game that is very close to my heart. It is one that I have played </p>
<p>since 2021 and has gotten me through mantimes through college and a way to kill time.</p>
<p>I also want to pursue horror one day, which is why this game also motivates me to make something new in the genre.</p>
<p>The other part that makes the loop fun is that you get different teammates every single time.</p>
<p>While you may get the same killer with a similar build each time, everyone plays different from one another.</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(123, 196, 244); font-size: 25px;">When playing, you tend to feel the weight of each move for both the killer and survivor gameplay.</h1>
